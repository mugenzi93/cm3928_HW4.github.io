I am an ambitious and dynamic scientist with a Master of Science degree in Biostatistics from Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. 

During my undergraduate education in Chemistry at the University of Central Arkansas, I served in different professional and research roles. As a result, I have a wide range of experience working at academic institutions, small companies (start ups), and research labs. 

During the summer of 2020, I was privileged to work with [Andrew Laine, PhD](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/andrew-laine) and [Elsa Angelini, PhD](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.angelini) in their research lab: [Heffner Biomedical Imaging Lab](https://hbil.bme.columbia.edu/). My goal in this research was to analyze segmented Computed Tomography (CT) images from COPD patients to:

* Create informative visualization plots showing transitions of emphysema subtypes from baseline to follow up.

* Quantify the amount of emphysema pixels present and study the association of emphysema subtypes from baseline to follow up using a Logistic regression model.

* Use supervised learning methods such as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to predict the percentage emphysema pixels we would expect at follow up.


**Side Note:**

I am a proactive learner, always seeking out challenging opportunities with an ultimate purpose to grow personally and professionally. 

I am also a data scientist, constantly looking to get involved in challenging projects in order to apply my analytical problem-solving skills and translate big picture ideas into tangible goals.
