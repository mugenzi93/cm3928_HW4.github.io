# Introduction

This titanic project is based on the infamous sinking of Titanic in 1912, a tragedy that led to `1,502` people dying out of `2,224` passengers. Datasets provided include the train dataset with `891` passengers whose survival fate is known and a test dataset with `418` passengers whose survival fate is unknown. I will first start by loading both datasets then combine them to do some feature engineering then use machine learning tools to predict what the survival fate for the passengers in the test dataset would have been.

## Loading the Dataset

```{r, message=FALSE}
# First, we will load the train dataset.
train = 
  read_csv("Data/train.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
# Second, the test dataset is loaded
test = 
  read_csv("Data/test.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
# Then both the train and test datasets are combined into a single dataset.
Titanic = 
  bind_rows(train, test) %>% 
  rename(gender = "sex")
```

After loading and combining both datasets, it is better to highlight what kind of dataset I will be working with.

Some of the variables important to highlight include name, passengerID, gender, age, and each individual's survival status. 

# Feature Engineering

## Summary of missing values 

The code chunk below summarises how many missing values we have per column.

```{r}
  Titanic %>%
    gather(key = "key", value = "val") %>%
    mutate(is.missing = is.na(val)) %>%
    group_by(key, is.missing) %>%
    summarise(num.missing = n()) %>%
    filter(is.missing == T) %>%
    select(-is.missing) %>%
    arrange(desc(num.missing)) %>%
    rename("Missing Values" = "num.missing", "Variable" = "key") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

We will not worry about the survived variable since all missing values correspond to the value we are trying to predict, which is the survival fate of persons in the test dataset.


## Defining Factor Variables

The code chunk below converts appropriate variables to factor variables.


```{r}
titanic =
  Titanic %>% 
  mutate(
    gender = recode(gender, "male" = "Male", "female" = "Female"),
    survived = recode(survived, "0" = "died", "1" = "survived"),
    embarked = recode(embarked, "C" = "Cherbourg", "S" = "Southampton",
                      "Q" = "Queenstown"),
    pclass = recode(pclass, "1" = "1st", "2" = "2nd", "3" = "3rd"),
    gender = factor(gender, levels = c("Male", "Female")),
    survived = factor(survived, levels = c("died", "survived")),
    embarked = factor(embarked, levels = c("Cherbourg", "Southampton",
                                           "Queenstown")),
    pclass = factor(pclass, levels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd")))
```


This is a dirty dataset and we either need to drop the rows with NaN values or fill in the gaps by leveraging the data in the dataset to estimate what those values could have been. We will choose the latter and try to estimate those values and fill in the gaps rather than lose observations.

## Creating a Family Variable

We all know that family usually have the same last name, therefore I will group families according to their last names to make it easier to create the family variable.

```{r}
# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
titanic$lastname = sapply(titanic$name,  
                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])
```


Since we have variables quantifying the number of family members present for a particular passenger, I will use those to create a brand new `Family` variable which can help us measure the likelihood a passenger will survive given the amount of family members they have on board with them (since family members usually have a tendency to not leave their people behind).

```{r}
# Creating a Family variable including the passenger themselves.
titanic$famsize = titanic$sib_sp + titanic$parch + 1

# Creating a Family variable
titanic$family = paste(titanic$lastname, titanic$famsize, sep = "_")
```

Thus, using the above created `Family` variable, I can visualize the association between family size and survival of a passenger. Note that the largest family was composed of **11** people.

```{r}
# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between family size & survival
ggplot(titanic[1:891,], aes(x = famsize, fill = factor(survived))) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'count', position = 'dodge') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:11)) +
  labs(x = 'Family Size') +
  theme_few()
```

And as expected, the larger the family gets the less likely an individual would have survived.

We can also visualize the relationship between `Age` and `Survival`

```{r}
# We'll look at the relationship between age & survival by gender.
ggplot(titanic[1:891,], aes(age, fill = survived)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", binwidth = 5) + 
  facet_grid(~gender) + 
  labs(
    title = "Association Between Survival and Age by Gender",
    x = "Age") +
  theme_few()
```

It is clear that the `Female` gender was likely to survive especially for female aged between 20-40 years old. This can be due to a lot of factors such as that mothers might have been more vulnerable, and thus were more likely to be rescued along with their young ones. On the male side, males in the `20-40` age group were more likely to die compared to males in other age groups because these men might have been involved in the rescuing other groups such as mothers, their kids, and the elderly.

## Cleaning Names

With the following code chunk, we will determine what different name titles we have and their distribution according to gender.

```{r}
# I will extract titles from the name variable
titanic$titles = gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', titanic$name)
table(titanic$gender, titanic$titles) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Let's now define all these different name titles as rare titles (for those titles which are really rare).

### Distribution of Titles by Gender

```{r}
# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')


# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
titanic = 
  titanic %>%
  mutate(
    titles = gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', titanic$name),
    titles = str_replace(titles, "Mlle", "Miss"),
    titles = str_replace(titles, "Ms", "Miss"),
    titles = str_replace(titles, "Mme", "Mrs"),
    titles = recode(titles, "Dona" = "Rare Title", "Lady" = "Rare Title",
                   "the Countess" = "Rare Title", "Capt" = "Rare Title",
                   "Col" = "Rare Title", "Don" = "Rare Title",
                   "Dr" = "Rare Title", "Major" = "Rare Title",
                   "Rev" = "Rare Title", "Sir" = "Rare Title",
                   "Jonkheer" = "Rare Title"))
titanic %>% 
  group_by(titles, gender) %>% 
  summarise(
    Frequency = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = titles,
    values_from = Frequency) %>%
  mutate(
    Master = replace_na(Master, 0),
    Miss = replace_na(Miss, 0),
    Mr = replace_na(Mr, 0),
    Mrs = replace_na(Mrs, 0)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


```{r}
titanic %>% 
  group_by(gender, pclass, titles) %>% 
  summarise(
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The table above gives us a short summary of how we should go about replacing all the missing age values. And as expected, those passengers with title name **Master** or **Mrs** tend to be younger than those with title names **Mrs** or **Mr.** It also looks like there is an age variability among passenger class (Pclass) where older passengers seem tend to be in the more luxurious 1st class. 

## Creating a mother and status Variable

To make it more interesting, I am going to create a `mother` and `status` variable to see whether being a mother or child is associated to survival.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Create the column status, and indicate whether child or adult
titanic$status[titanic$age < 18] = "Child"
titanic$status[titanic$age >= 18] = "Adult"

# Show counts
table(titanic$status, titanic$survived)
```

Next, let us create the `mother` variable.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Adding Mother variable
titanic$mother = 'Not Mother'
titanic$mother[
  titanic$gender == 'female' & titanic$parch > 0 
  & titanic$age > 18 & titanic$titles != 'Miss'] = 'Mother'

# Show counts
table(titanic$mother, titanic$survived)
```

Now let us convert both variables created in factor variables 

```{r}
titanic = 
  titanic %>% 
  mutate(
    status = factor(status, levels = c("Adult", "Child")),
    mother = factor(mother, levels = c("Not Mother", "Mother"))) %>% 
  select(-family)
```

# Missingness 

## The Age variable 

There are **`r sum(is.na(titanic$age))`** missing age values. We will use a technique of replacing the missing age values using a model that predicts age based on other variables. I will use the **Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (Mice)** package to predict what missing age values would have been based on other variables.


```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
set.seed(129)
tit_mod = mice(titanic[, !names(titanic) %in% c("passenger_id","name","ticket","cabin","titles","survived")], 
                 method = "rf") 
tit_output = complete(tit_mod)
```

After running this mice model, I am worried that it might have compromised my original titanic dataset. So let use some visualization to see if nothing changed.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(titanic$age, freq = F, main = 'Age: Original Data', 
  col = 'darkgreen', ylim = c(0,0.04))
hist(tit_output$age, freq = F, main = 'Age: MICE Output', 
  col = 'lightgreen', ylim = c(0,0.04))
```

Now that everything looks good, let us replace all the missing age values using the mice model I just built. 

```{r}
titanic$age = tit_output$age
sum(is.na(titanic$age))
```

## The Cabin variable

With cabin having a total of `r sum(is.na(titanic$cabin))` missing values, I will just replace all of them with letter **U** which stands for **Unknown.**


```{r}
titanic$cabin = replace_na("U")
sum(is.na(titanic$cabin))
```

## The Embarked variable

Here, I will just replace the `r sum(is.na(titanic$embarked))` missing values based on on the amount of money they paid to embark (fare variable). We can easily visualize this by plotting the embarked, fare, and passenger class (Pclass) variables on the boxplot.

```{r}
# Get rid of our missing passenger IDs
embark_fare = titanic %>%
  filter(passenger_id != 62 & passenger_id != 830)

# Use ggplot2 to visualize embarkment, passenger class, & median fare
ggplot(embark_fare, aes(x = embarked, y = fare, fill = factor(pclass))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 80), 
    colour = "red", linetype = "dashed", lwd = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  theme_few()
```


Therefore, looking at the plot, we can safely conclude that both passengers embarked from the **Cherbourg** port, so I will replace both missing values with the corresponding port of embarkment.

```{r}
titanic$embarked[c(62, 830)] = 'Cherbourg'
sum(is.na(titanic$embarked))
```

## The Fare variable


```{r}
ggplot(titanic[titanic$pclass == "3rd" & titanic$embarked == "Southampton", ], 
  aes(x = fare)) +
  geom_density(fill = "gray50", alpha = 0.4) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(fare, na.rm = T)),
    colour = 'black', linetype = "dashed", lwd = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Payment",
    x = "Fare") +
  theme_few()
```

Therefore, I will replace the missing value with the median of the **3rd** passenger class.

```{r}
titanic$fare[1044] = 
  median(titanic[titanic$pclass == "3rd" & titanic$embarked == "Southampton", ]$fare, 
         na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(titanic$fare))
```

After this step, the final `Titanic` dataset should be cleaned without missing values and necessary variables for the `Prediction` stage.

# Model Building

## Splitting the Dataset

I will split the `Titanic` dataset back to the `Train` and `Test` datasets.

```{r}
train = titanic[1:891,]
test = titanic[892:1309,]
```

I will use the `RandomForest` algorithm to build the model by using the `Survival` variable in the `Train` dataset.



```{r}
# Set a random seed
set.seed(754)

# Build the model (note: not all possible variables are used)
rf_model = randomForest(survived ~ pclass + gender + age + sib_sp + parch +
                          fare + embarked + famsize + mother, 
                        data = train)
                                             
# Show model error
plot(rf_model, ylim = c(0,0.36))
legend('topright', colnames(rf_model$err.rate), col = 1:3, fill = 1:3)
```
